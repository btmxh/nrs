# NRS Change Log

## NRS 1.0

Release Date: July 8, 2021 

This version is based on the lastest NRS specification and implementation on the previously hosted on Google Sheet NRS, which didn't have a versioning system.

## NRS 1.0.1

This is a temporary patch for NRS 1.0

Release Date: August 17, 2021

Changes compared to NRS 1.0:

* Added changelog.md
* Max influential time is removed from waifu scores, and is replaced by the hardcoded value of 180 days (6 months), which is to make implementing NRS a bit easier.
* Fixed waifu score formula in specification
* Changed prefix of non-MAL light novel/manga from "L+" to "LP" (the plus sign is not allowed in IDs)
* Reputation/Legacy score not intended for NRS 1.1 anymore (NRS will go straight for 2.0, see issue #5)

## NRS 2.0
